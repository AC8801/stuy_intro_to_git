The Sample_Shell_Script.sh file is a simple program that you will run in your terminal on the Raspberry Pi.

## Instructions

In this projects directory in your linux shell run 

```
$ ./Sample_Shell_Script.sh
```

When you run it for the first time you will see one error message and one mistake.

Open the script with the Text Editor and using what you have learned from the Shell Workshop tutorial and some online research, fix the code so that the shell script runs correctly.

## Expected Output

We have included a text file in this repo that shows the expected output from the shell program. Once you have completed fixing the bugs, ensure that your output exactly matches the expected output file.
